Using DjTracker
*****************************

The most important part of an issue tracker is being able to effeciently use it.

Users and Profiles
=============================

Typically you'll want to setup a user account when using DjTracker. You can add one via the Django Administration screens, or you can also register via DjTracker as well. This is powered by ``django-registration``. You'll receive an email with your activation link, click on that, and then proceed to login.

** Future Plans **: Profiles are currently bare bones, and you can really modify them much. This will change in the future.

After you've created a profile you can have issues assigned to you, 'watch' issues, and save issue filters.

Getting Organized
=============================

Assuming you have a user, there's a variety of things you can do to get yourself organized. First off, there's the rudimentary search in the sidebar. This'll allow you to search a project, or all projects, for issues containing whatever keyword you type in.

Second, there's issue filtering. When you go to a project page, you can click to "View All Issues". At that screen you have a slew of filtering options. These allow you to pinpoint an exact set of criteria for that project of issues that you'd like to find. You may also save these filters for future use. They will then appear on your dashboard for future use (and removal once you're done with them).

Third, you can also 'watch' an issue. This means that when the issue is updated, you'll automatically be updated as such. You can manually choose to watch an issue, but you'll also be added to the watch list if the issue is assigned to you.

Finally, on your dashboard you'll have a set of four lists. These lists are "Recently Updated", "Assigned", "Created", and "Commented On". This lets you easily find issues you've recently worked on.
